      <p>If you see this text WITH the normal header, footer, and background/styling, then base.html is likely okay, and the problem was in the complex content we previously had in this index.html file.</p>
      <p>If this page ALSO looks broken (like just plain, unstyled text with no header/footer), then the problem is almost certainly within base.html itself.</p>
